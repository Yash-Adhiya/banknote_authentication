The dataset consists of 1372 examples and 4 features for binary classification. The features are

variance of a wavelet-transformed image (continuous)
skewness of a wavelet-transformed image (continuous)
kurtosis of a wavelet-transformed image (continuous)
entropy of the image (continuous)
(You can fine more details about this dataset at https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/banknote+authentication.)

In essence, these four features represent features that were manually extracted from image data.
